Step for Setup Local Image Repository with Podman in Linux Debian Buster 10/Feodora 33

## Execute the following command to create a new directory for storing the podman/docker container: 
mkdir -pv /var/lib/registry 

## Create a new user to run the podman as non-root user:
useradd podman
passwd podman

## Add non-root user to sudo group
usermod -a -G sudo podman

## Set Permission for /var/lib/registry directory just created for non-root user podman
chown -Rv podman.podman /var/lib/registry/

## Edit /etc/containers/registries.conf and add the following lines
[registries.search]
registries = ['registry.access.redhat.com','registry.fedoraproject.org','registry.centos.org','docker.io']

[registries.insecure]
registries = ['localhost:5000']

[registries.block]
registries = []

## To Test the Local Repository just created, try to pull an image from external repositoriesand then push it to the local registry repository. 
podman pull hello-world

## Verify pulled images
podman images

## Tag the pulled image first before pushing the image to the local repository registry:  
podman tag docker.io/library/hello-world localhost:5000/hello-world

## Verify the image tagged as localhost:5000/hello-world
podman images

## Now push  "pulled image localhost:5000/hello-world" to the local repository: 
podman push localhost:5000/hello-world

### Finally run the image from the localhost repository  and If you see this message, Cheers..
## (Hello from Docker! This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly).
podman run localhost:5000/hello-world
